        Now it has grown to be so clear
The unfamiliar shadow amidst those cheers
Perhaps I wouldn't be able to believe words:
"Let's see and hear only good things" no more
Your silent sadness, it shakes me
In my quiet sea, waves would sometimes rise

Louder than bombs, I break (Ah)
All the pain pour out (Ah)
From the moment I knew
The expression you had on wasn't that expression
Louder than bombs, I break (Oh, oh, oh)
    </p>

    <p class="lead text-white">
        Baby, I'm nothin'er than nothin'
 Brighter than the light
 Don't you want a thing from me
 But you say I'm somethin'er than somethin'
 Brighter than the light
 Don't you give up your life
 Here I stay, pray
 Just for better days
 Everyday a maze
 Wonder if this is my place

            Where's my way?
The ground keeps quaking
I collapse on my own, mute
Louder than bombs, yeah
I want to tell you, that darkness
Exists everywhere, don't be afraid of it
Whatever night may swallow me, I won't give up
The fight for you, we'll shine
            </p>
